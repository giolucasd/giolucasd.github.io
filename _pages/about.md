Computer scientist from Unicamp with software engineering and data science experience in artificial intelligence products.

My main web development technology stack includes Python, JavaScript, SQL, Docker and AWS. While my main experience in data science includes solving NLP tasks using spaCy upon in-house Python built libraries for MLOps.

I believe quality and efficiency in software creation processes are tightly coupled. Therefore, I seek good practices from design to operation, prioritizing the development of quality software within a DevOps set of practices that includes tests, CI/CD, open communication and more.

Projects with health or social impact have a special taste for me!

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
